# Project Backlog
For simplicity, the project backlog is being managed within the code base for now. This is not a definitive or final list of requirements. All product backlog items are subject to the usual processes refinement and prioritisation used in Agile software development. This product backlog might be moved to a tool like Jira in the future.

## For Apprentices (Primary User Role)

### Capture Evidence for Each Criterion
As a software development apprentice building a portfolio of evidence, I want to record my Knowledge, Skills, and Behaviours (KSBs) along with links and descriptions of supporting evidence so that I can demonstrate my competence against all required criteria.

### Add Multiple Pieces of Evidence per Criterion
As a software development apprentice building a portfolio of evidence, I want to attach multiple documents, URLs, and reflections to each KSB criterion so that I can showcase a range of work that supports my growth.

Note: consider revising this. It's preferred that there are fewer pieces of evidence that map to multiple KSBs.

### View a Summary Dashboard
As a software development apprentice building a portfolio of evidence, I want to see a dashboard that summarises which KSBs are complete, partially complete, or missing evidence so that I can track my progress at a glance.

### Search and Filter Criteria
As a software development apprentice building a portfolio of evidence, I want to quickly search or filter KSBs by keywords (e.g. 'database', 'testing') so that I can efficiently find the criteria I need to address next.

### Export Evidence for Submission
As a software development apprentice building a portfolio of evidence, I want to export all my recorded evidence and reflections to a well-formatted PDF or CSV so that I can easily submit my portfolio to my assessor.

### Reflect on Personal Growth
As a software development apprentice building a portfolio of evidence, I want to add personal reflections on how I improved my KSBs over time so that I can demonstrate not just competence, but also my learning journey.

### Tag Evidence by Project
As a software development apprentice building a portfolio of evidence, I want to tag each piece of evidence with project names or technologies used so that I can easily reference work done in different contexts and link my learning to real-world tasks.

### Receive Data Validation Feedback
As a software development apprentice building a portfolio of evidence, I want to receive validation prompts or warnings if I leave certain fields empty or if my evidence is missing a link so that I ensure my portfolio is consistently detailed and complete.


## For the Internal Assessor

### Review Apprentice Evidence
As an internal assessor, I want to securely log in and view each apprentice’s recorded evidence mapped to KSBs so that I can efficiently evaluate their progress and readiness for the final assessment.

### Leave Feedback and Recommendations
As an internal assessor, I want to leave private comments or recommendations directly against specific KSB evidence so that apprentices can receive targeted feedback to improve their portfolios.

### Generate Assessment Reports
As an internal assessor, I want to quickly generate a report that summarizes an apprentice’s strengths, areas needing improvement, and overall readiness so that I can streamline the final review process.

## For the Instructor

### Curate Example Evidence
As an instructor supporting apprentices, I want to upload sample evidence or exemplars linked to certain KSBs so that apprentices have a clear idea of what high-quality supporting material looks like.

### Monitor Cohort Progress
As an instructor, I want to view a high-level dashboard showing how many apprentices have completed evidence submission for each KSB so that I can identify common gaps and address them in group sessions.

### Manage KSB Definitions and Standards
As an instructor, I want to be able to update or adjust KSB definitions or add clarifications so that all apprentices have the most current and accurate criteria to guide their evidence submission.

## For the Employer

### Employer Insights
As an employer, I want to view a read-only, anonymized summary of apprentice progress (e.g., which KSBs are well-covered across the cohort) so that I can understand the effectiveness of the training and identify skill gaps to focus on in future projects.

### Compliance and Security Checks
As an employer concerned about compliance, I want to ensure that any uploaded evidence meets data protection standards (e.g., removing personally identifiable or client-sensitive info) so that my organization remains compliant with legal and regulatory requirements.
